### Hi and Welcome ðŸ‘‹

## INTRO

My name is Carol Kadish and I have two main passions; Data and Yoga.  I am currently working as a teachers assistant (TA) for Trilogy at Case Western University for the Data Science Course. I am also working as a part-time Yoga instructor helping private clients virtually or outdoors.
